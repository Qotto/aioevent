""" BaseResult Module

A *result* is a record containing results of the processing of a command.

Results should be sent to the **coffeemakerâ€‘results** topic.

Results should use the *tonga.coffeemaker.results* namespace.

Commands have the same fields as records, and a few additional ones:

   - *error*: an optional field describing the error that occurred during the command processing.
     If this field is empty, it means that the command was successfully completed. The *error* field has two specific
     sub-fields:

        - *label*: a short label describing the error (a string without any white space)
        - *message*: a human-readable description of the error
